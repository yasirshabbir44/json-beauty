# JSON Schema Generator Fix

## Issue
The application was unable to find the import `{ generate as generateSchema } from 'json-schema-generator'` which was causing build errors.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the issue, we found several problems:

1. The `json-schema-generator` package was not installed in the project.
2. When we installed it, we discovered that it:
   - Does not export a named function called `generate`
   - Instead exports a default function called `jsonToSchema`
   - Depends on Node.js-specific modules like 'crypto' which are not available in browser environments
   - Has TypeScript type definitions that require the 'allowSyntheticDefaultImports' flag

## Solution
We implemented a multi-step solution:

1. **Package Replacement**: 
   - Replaced `json-schema-generator` with `generate-schema`, which is more browser-compatible
   - Installed it using: `npm install generate-schema --save`

2. **Import Statement Update**:
   - Changed the import from:
     ```typescript
     import { generate as generateSchema } from 'json-schema-generator';
     ```
   - To:
     ```typescript
     import * as generateSchemaLib from 'generate-schema';
     const generateSchema = generateSchemaLib.json;
     ```

3. **TypeScript Type Definitions**:
   - Created a custom type definition file at `src/app/types/generate-schema.d.ts`
   - Defined the module structure to match the actual package exports

## Verification
The application now builds successfully without any errors related to the JSON schema generation functionality.

## Notes for Future Reference
- When using third-party packages, always verify:
  - The package is installed
  - The package exports match your import statements
  - The package is compatible with your environment (browser vs. Node.js)
  - TypeScript type definitions exist or need to be created
- Consider using more modern and well-maintained packages for JSON schema generation in the future
