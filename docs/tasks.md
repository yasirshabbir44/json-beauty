# JSON Beauty Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the JSON Beauty application. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Refactor the JsonEditorComponent (1500+ lines) into smaller, more focused components:
   - [ ] Extract JSON visualization logic to a dedicated component
   - [ ] Extract JSON comparison logic to a dedicated component
   - [ ] Extract search/replace functionality to a dedicated component

2. [ ] Implement state management pattern:
   - [ ] Evaluate and integrate NgRx or a similar state management library
   - [ ] Define clear actions, reducers, and selectors for JSON operations
   - [ ] Migrate from direct service calls to state-based approach

3. [ ] Improve module organization:
   - [ ] Create feature modules for major functionality areas (editor, conversion, validation)
   - [ ] Implement lazy loading for feature modules
   - [ ] Create shared module for common components and directives

4. [ ] Enhance error handling architecture:
   - [ ] Implement global error handling service
   - [ ] Create standardized error response format
   - [ ] Add error logging and reporting mechanism

5. [ ] Implement comprehensive configuration management:
   - [ ] Create configuration service for app-wide settings
   - [ ] Support environment-specific configurations
   - [ ] Add user preference persistence

## Code Quality Improvements

6. [ ] Improve type safety:
   - [ ] Replace any remaining 'any' types with specific interfaces

   - [ ] Create more specific error types

7. [ ] Enhance error handling:
   - [ ] Add consistent try-catch blocks for all external operations
   - [ ] Improve error messages with more context
   - [ ] Implement proper error propagation

8. [ ] Reduce code duplication:
   - [ ] Extract common JSON parsing logic to utility functions
   - [ ] Create reusable error handling functions
   - [ ] Standardize conversion result handling

9. [ ] Improve code organization:
   - [ ] Follow consistent naming conventions
   - [ ] Organize imports alphabetically
   - [ ] Group related functions together

## Testing Improvements

10. [ ] Increase test coverage:
    - [ ] Add unit tests for all services
    - [ ] Create component tests for UI functionality
    - [ ] Implement integration tests for key user flows

11. [ ] Improve test quality:
    - [ ] Add edge case testing
    - [ ] Implement property-based testing for JSON operations
    - [ ] Create test fixtures for common test scenarios

12. [ ] Set up continuous integration:
    - [ ] Configure automated test runs
    - [ ] Add code coverage reporting
    - [ ] Implement linting checks in CI pipeline

## Performance Improvements

13. [ ] Optimize JSON processing:
    - [ ] Implement lazy parsing for large JSON documents
    - [ ] Add pagination for large JSON arrays
    - [ ] Optimize memory usage for large documents
